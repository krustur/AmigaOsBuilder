# AmigaOsBuilder

## About
Used by myself to compose my version of Amiga OS.

Built using as a .NET Core Command Line tool, so it might work on Apple and Linux.

Currently most stuff is configured by code, but should be moved to external json files. I might build some ui to make the json files easier to manage in the future.

## How to use it
